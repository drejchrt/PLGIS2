# PLGIS2

The app has been deployed online @ [bierli.django.group](bierli.django.group) . Since I was not able to migrate the
database itself I had to create some dummy entries. This has revealed some bugs, that I fixed **after the deadline** in
order to make the code usable. However those were really minor changes. I also had to edit some lines in order to run
the app on the sever, because it uses a slightly different settings etc. I have naturally also encountered some major
bugs, that I didn't know of in my dev settings, however I left those unchanged, if they weren't absolutely necessary for
the app to run/ for the presentation.

The last commit is code that I've submitted to TUWEL. The actual commit has the code that is running now on the server.

I've e-mailed you the login credentials.
