# PLGIS2

Dear Marvin, dear Markus,

the APP as it is cannot be run as it's missing the database. The app is designed so, that without an account, one cannot
use the app, hence the database, which contains the users is crucial for this

I'll try to get a server running soon and as soon as it's up I'll e-mail you the address and the login credentials
